E-Voting Platform designed by Vincent Nguyen and Carson Smith

In order to run our e-voting platform, first you must run the MySQL scripts that are stored in the database scripts directory. These are labelled with a leading number
to indicate which order they should be ran and do all of the work for you. 

Next, you must changed the static variable at the top of the GUI class to equal your ROOT MySQL account password. This allows access to all of the db calls.

Finally, you can run our GUI class and enjoy it in all of its' glory!
